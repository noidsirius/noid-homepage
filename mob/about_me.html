			        			<p>
			        				My name is "Navid Salehnamadi" (In Persian 
			        				"نوید صالح‌نمدی") and
			        				I was born in <strong> December 1<sup>st</sup> ,1992</strong>. I had amazing childhood, I grew up in Tehran (a polluted and populated city) and a village called "Ferizhand". I went to gymnastics and won the gold medal in a competition in our city region. In my primary school, I started to play chess and found it very interesting. Chess taught me how to think in a proper way.

		        			<p>
		        				I went to Allameh Helli High School(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents">NODET</a>), a school for talented students. I started to learn about computer science and artificial intelligence by joining a team to compete in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup_3D_Soccer_Simulation_League"> 3D Soccer Simulation League </a> (which qualified in International Robocup Competition), then designed and developed a multi-agent solution for  <a href="http://roborescue.sourceforge.net/"> Rescue Simulation League </a> with my teammates. We participated in Khwarizmi Robotics Competition and got the second place in the country.
		        			</p>
		        			<p>
		        				Then my friends and I concenterated on creating a Traffic Simulator, which simulated the traffic jam flow based on traffic lights' behaviour. This project ranked second place in Khwarizmi Young Award (Tehran) .
		        			</p>
		        			<p>
		        				A year after that, I qualified to participate in Iranian National Olympiad in Informatics and I won the silver medal.

		        			<p>
		        				There is a competitive exam to enter the best universities in Iran which is called "Konkoor" . With my Khwarizmi award and medal in Informatics Olympiad, I applied for <a href="http://ut.ac.ir/en">University of Tehran</a>. I got admitted by passing an interview (without taking entrance exam - Konkoor) as talented student. 
		        			</p>
		        			<p>
		        				I continued studying AI and algorithms in university and I have passed Artificial Intelligence, Multi-Agent Systems, Social Networks Analysis and Game Theory courses.  
		        			</p>
		        			<p>
		        				I like problem solving specially in algorithms, so I participated as contestant in ACM/ICPC contest and ranked 9<sup>th</sup> in 2013 regional contest (SouthWest Asia). Moreover, I ranked 1<sup>st</sup> in the National University Students Olympiad in Iran.
		        			</p>
		        			<p>
		        				I worked for a period in a company (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/company/iranian-congenial-mobile-co.">Cafe Bazaar</a>) as a developer. Bazaar is a Persian android marketplace and I was in a team that researched and developed the relation between apps and grouping them.
		        			</p>
		        			<p>
		        				I am vice-chair of ACM student chapter in our university, and there are lots of activity being organized there: Scientific Talks, AI Contests, ICPC Contests and a lot more.
